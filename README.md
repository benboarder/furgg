furgg
=====

furgg is a fullScreen responsive grid gallery; clean and lightweight for mobile and desktop environments.

Allows huge flexability by reflowing the grid according to screen dimensions.
The code and markup have been modified heavily from it's original form to make the library extremly lightweight and the perfect boilerplate for your own projects.

It was originally developed to be used in my own portfolio. Check it out here:
